                            World War II combatives are techniques used in close quarters combat,
                            including hand-to-hand fighting, advanced firearm point shooting methods,
                            and weapons techniques (knife/bayonet/improvised weapons).

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <li>World War II combatives are rooted in British colonial history with the Shanghai Municipal
                Police (1854–1943),
                pioneers of modern SWAT, who operated in what was widely acknowledged
                as the most dangerous port city in the world at the time.
                After studying under some of the finest warriors of pre-Communist China and pre-war Japan,
                these officers condensed the most practical elements of these arts,
                combined it with elements of Shanghai gangster fighting,
                and field-tested their skills in over 2000 documented encounters,
                including over 600 lethal force engagements</li>
            <li>Upon return to the UK and US, veterans of the Shanghai Municipal Police were
                tasked in training allied World War II commandos and intelligence personnel,
                including the British Commandos - SAS & SBS, the US/Canadian 1st Special Service Force
                ("Devil's Brigade"),
                the Office of Strategic Services (precursor to the CIA), the British Special Operation
                Executive,
                Marine Raider Units, and the US Army Rangers. Upon engagement with enemy personnel skilled
                in
                classical European arts and old school judo, the post-battlefield reports of
                the “Shanghai method” produced the highest number of documented kills of any combatives
                system to date.</li>
            <li>After World War II, with no institutional system of educating new instructors,
                the rise of Asian martial arts in the US, and the increasing role of the military
                in a peacekeeping capacity, realistic CQC training degenerated and in many places,
                died out. Thanks to the promotion of modified World War II combatives
                by modern warriors such as Carl Cestari and Bob Kasper, Kelly Mcann, Clint Sporman,
                Lawrence A. Jordan, and John Perkins these proven methods and techniques are beginning to
                make a strong comeback</li>
